# RAG Food System – Customised by Dennis Bonnici

This is my enhanced version of the RAG-Food project. I added 100 food items focused on:
- Cultural cuisines from countries including Philippines, Thailand, Vietname, India, China 
- Healthy foods with detailed nutrition benefits
- Popular international dishes with cooking methods

# 🧠 RAG-Food: Simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation with ChromaDB + Ollama

This is a **minimal working RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** demo using:

- ✅ Local LLM via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- ✅ Local embeddings via `mxbai-embed-large`
- ✅ [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) as the vector database
- ✅ A simple food dataset in JSON (Filipino foods, fruits, etc.)

---

## 🎯 What This Does

This app allows you to ask questions like:

- “Which foods include chickpeas?”
- “What dessert is made from milk and cream?”
- “What is Halo-Halo made of and what are its main ingredients?”

It **does not rely on the LLM’s built-in memory**. Instead, it:

1. **Embeds your custom text data** (about food) using `mxbai-embed-large`
2. Stores those embeddings in **ChromaDB**
3. For any question, it:
   - Embeds your question
   - Finds relevant context via similarity search
   - Passes that context + question to a local LLM (`llama3.2`)
4. Returns a natural-language answer grounded in your data.

## 📦 Requirements

### ✅ Software

- Python 3.8+
- Ollama installed and running locally
- ChromaDB installed

### ✅ Ollama Models Needed

Run these in your terminal to install them:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
````

> Make sure `ollama` is running in the background. You can test it with:
>
> ```bash
> ollama run llama3.2
> ```

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone or download this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrambiguous8/my_ragfood_database_wk3/Local_version
cd Local_Version
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install chromadb requests
```

### 3. Run the RAG app

```bash
python rag_run.py
```

If it's the first time, it will:

* Create `fooddatabase.json` if missing
* Generate embeddings for all food items
* Load them into ChromaDB
* Run a few example questions

## 📁 File Structure

```

├── rag_run.py        # Main app script
├── fooddatabase.json # Food knowledge base (created if missing)
├── README.md         # This file
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Data** is loaded from `fooddatabase.json`
2. Each entry is embedded using Ollama's `mxbai-embed-large`
3. Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB
4. When you ask a question:

   * The question is embedded
   * The top 1–2 most relevant chunks are retrieved
   * The context + question is passed to `llama3.2`
   * The model answers using that info only

---

## 🔍 Try Custom Questions

You can update `rag_run.py` to include your own questions like:

```python
print(rag_query("What is Adobo?"))
print(rag_query("Which foods are vegetarian?"))
```

---

## 🚀 Next Ideas

* Swap in larger datasets (Wikipedia articles, recipes, PDFs)
* Add a web UI with Gradio or Flask
* Cache embeddings to avoid reprocessing on every run
